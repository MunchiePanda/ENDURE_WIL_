/*
What does => mean in C# Getters?
You might have seen => in your code, like this:
This is called an expression-bodied member (or expression-bodied property in this case). It's a shorthand way to write very simple getters and setters (or methods) in C#.
Think of it like this:
get => healthField;
This means: "When someone tries to get the Health property, just give them the value of healthField." It's a quick way to say get { return healthField; }.
set => healthField = value;
This means: "When someone tries to set the Health property, take the value they're giving and put it into healthField." It's a quick way to say set { healthField = value; }.
