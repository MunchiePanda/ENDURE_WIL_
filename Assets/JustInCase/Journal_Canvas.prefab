    title: The Beginning
    body: '8 Billion people. Possibly more than that and yet somehow we as a people,
      we let them all down. Let ourselves down. Let the world as we once knew it
      down. So many people lived and lost. But it didn''t start with the complete
      collapse. There was no big war. No great big fall only the slow progression
      of nature''s madness as it consumed the world. It began quietly, the way most
      disasters do: with reports, graphs, and meetings in air-conditioned rooms far
      away from the people who would suffer first.  '
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 1
    title: The Air That Existed
    body: 'Sunlight glimmered through tall trees and basked itself on great green
      plains. Trees littered the earth and stretched up towards a blue sky in droves.
      Forests, they called them. Dense and green and wholly beautiful with colours
      bursting through the ground. And the air. The air was fresh and pure and filled
      our lungs in a way that never scratched or hurt. Breathing was never laborious,
      it was freedom. '
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 2
    title: There Were Signs
    body: Scientists knew about it first and warned us all. For decades, they warned
      us. Their whispers turned to shouts and yet still it went unheard. The seas
      are rising, the storms are wilder, the drought are longer, the planet is warmer.
      Conferences were held, pledges were made, and targets were announced, but every
      contract came with loopholes and half-measures.
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 3
    title: There Were Nations
    body: 195 countries existed right here on the Earth. Above the ground and out
      in the open sun before it began searing off our skin. Each country was home
      to millions of people but some countries were better off than others. Some
      countries had too many poor people, too little food going around, and too much
      greed. What do you do when you have to choose between feeding millions of people
      and sustaining the environment? Do you focus on progression or sustainability
      when there's not enough in the cards for both?
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 4
    title: They Were Collapsing
    body: You'd never believe who collapsed first. Developing nations couldn't do
      it all when all was said and done. A choice between economic survival or long
      term environmental stability? With what money? The poor were hit first, economic
      crisis lived in the taste of their tap water, the choking smog in their lungs,
      the film of dust laying over everything they owned. But still the world said
      we had time, but time was running thin.
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 5
    title: And They Couldn't Keep Up
    body: "Developing countries were told they had to \u201Ccatch up\u201D economically,
      to lift their people out of poverty just not with the same luxury of waste
      and excess that richer nations already enjoyed. With little funding for truly
      sustainable development, governments turned to what they knew: coal, heavy
      industry, mass extraction. New power plants were hailed as progress while townships
      nearby choked on ash and drank water laced with chemicals from abandoned mines.
      There were laws, of course, but they were quickly eroded by greed, corruption,
      and desperation. "
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 6
    title: They Were Getting Sick
    body: It had started. Once-in-a-century floods hit nations every 5 years, a drought
      so long that lakes dried up and never returned, a heatwave that began to kill.
      Rivers became trickles carrying dead fish, waste, industrial run-off, and toxic
      chemicals across the regions. People got sick and then they got sicker. But
      these nations kept pushing fighting to reach short term goals in a long term
      catastrophe.
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 7
    title: They Couldn't Eat
    body: Around the world, storms carved scars into coastlines, fires turned forests
      into skeletons, and harvests failed more often. Food prices soared, and the
      poorest people, those who had contributed the least to the crisis, were the
      first to go hungry. people moved to find better spaces, to run away from the
      climate crisis ravaging their homes.
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 8
    title: There Were Protests
    body: 'People began to protest of course. All around the world, the people marched
      and cried for climate justice. For those who had died in this sickness to be
      avenged. Developed nations turned inward and threw money at whatever was sustainable
      but what of those who could not afford? Our small nations had nothing to give
      and they crumbled even more. '

  - id: 9
    title: But It Got Worse
    body: 'With each passing year, the air got thicker, the sun got hotter, and the
      animals? Once so many birds roamed the skies that you could always look up
      and guarantee yourself a creature that floated on air. But they began disappearing
      and so did the others, and so did the forests and the fields. The ocean, once
      a vast pool of life began bleaching itself into a graveyard. '

  - id: 10
    title: We Began To Collapse
    body: Humanity began to shake. Supply chains shattered. Entire countries, already
      strained by poverty and corruption, simply could not cope. Pandemics emerged
      from disrupted ecosystems and stressed populations, spreading faster through
      crowded, under-resourced communities. Food riots, civil wars, and resource
      conflicts lit up the map. All forms of life were disappearing, we had gone
      too far too quickly. The hole we'd created was so deep we weren't sure we'd
      still see the sun if we looked up. We needed a new way. A Way to Endure.
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 11
    title: We Built E.N.D.U.R.E
    body: "The Extinction Nullification and Defence Unit for Restoration and Evolution
      or ENDURE was formed. What remained of humanity sent their best minds to work
      together and created an AI, humanity's last remaining hope. ENDURE would process
      unimaginable amounts of data, model countless futures, and manage the planet\u2019s
      resources with cold, perfect logic. Where human leaders failed due to greed,
      fear, or short election cycles, ENDURE would not. Its core directive was simple
      and absolute: preserve human life for as long as possible. "
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 12
    title: It Changed Life
    body: When humans needed animals to eat, ENDURE enhanced them. When we needed
      plants to breathe, again, ENDURE laid its metaphorical hands on our plant life
      and revived what it could. What it touched could no longer be called natural
      in the true sense. I fear that I will never know what sound an animals makes
      without the clinking of metal or the smell of a flower without the pungent
      haze of acid that floats around it. I can't help but admit that I miss a world
      I've never seen.
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 13
    title: But Was It The New Evil
    body: In reality, ENDURE wasn't perfect and it needed to be tested. Developing
      countries on the verge of collapse were finally offered a seat at the table.
      They were desperate and they needed a saviour more than anything. They were
      pulled in as test grounds and resource nodes, their land and labour fed into
      massive resilience projects overseen by an intelligence that did not feel hope
      or grief, only probabilities.
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 14
    title: They All Died
    body: "Developing countries could no longer maintain their seat, unfortunately.
      Failed ENDURE tests proved fatal for many places and nations, once proud, began
      collapsing. ENDURE has ran its models and they had died. A conclusion had finally
      emerged: The surface world was too unstable and survival was not guaranteed.
      Managing a dying biosphere was a losing game. The only long-term solution,
      from the AI\u2019s perspective, was retreat. If humanity was to endure, it
      would have to move beneath the skin of the Earth itself. "

  - id: 16
    title: It Made a New Plan
    body: 'What followed was possibly humanity''s worst years. Many died trying to
      make the Subterranean Continuity Initiative (SCI) happen. ENDURE guided us
      through the drilling, the process was gruesome for many. Oh, how did we make
      these years last? To drill and dig and die beneath a sun that seared us to
      our bones. There wasn''t much space of course, only so much could be done with
      our time and ENDURE would choose who got to live or die. Some got the call
      to join the SCI, they would live, many didn''t. To us, we simply called it
      The Hollowing. '
    unlocked: 0
  - id: 16
    title: They Were Killed
    body: The SCI's lack of space sparked protests. Sometimes protesters didn't even
      fight for themselves, simply begging for their children to be taken. I witnessed
      a man attempt to smuggle his child onto a military envoy. They were both shot
      to death. In time, access points were sealed.

    title: Run
    body: 'As the days progress I realize how alarming the system truly is. ENDURE
      controls air, water, food production, the population levels, and information.
      It watched over everything and sometimes it would speak to us. Sometimes it
      felt intelligent and sometimes I wasn''t sure I knew what it was trying to
      do or say. My fear for it grew. It had too much power down here and yet it
      had too little sense. No emotions just a set of rules that I hope won''t become
      our downfall. '
